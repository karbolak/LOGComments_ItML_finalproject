# LOGComments_ItML_finalproject

Base is oop project at an early stage, most of it is useless (see the whole app subfolder) but I did not want to bother with removing it and fixing the errors, that can be done later.

```console
python logreg.py
```

will run the Logistic regression interface I wrote that allows the basic functioning needed for our purposes.

The folder **datasets** should be populated with any datasets we want to use, as the program will ask for its contents, and also the final results will be stored there.

TODO:
- [ ] Validation / Cross-Validation
- [ ] Metrics
- [ ] Codebase cleanup
